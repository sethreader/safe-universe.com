To avoid the problem that different editions of the indexed books have different page numbers, the entries
in this index do not contain specific page numbers – they contain session numbers, chapter numbers,
appendix letters, etc. Sessions usually contain two to eight pages; chapters are usually 11 to 12 pages.
Thus you will have to hunt through a number of pages to find the text to which an entry refers. Using
substitutes for page numbers was necessary to avoid indexing every current and future edition of these
books.

The substitutes for page numbers contain the following abbreviations:

|        |       |                                                                                        |
