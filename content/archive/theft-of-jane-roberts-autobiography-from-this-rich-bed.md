A bit of a bummer. On or shortly after November 17, 2017 Laurel Davies-Butts –second wife of Robert Butts– asked her followers and Facebook friends what works of Jane Roberts and Robert Butts they would like to see published. One of the first commenters wishes for Jane's autobiography to be published. In reply to that, Laurel mentions that "From This Rich Bed" has been stolen from her house after she finished reading it.

In another comment in the thread, she suspects that someone must have specifically broken into her house to steal this book, either to publish it or to make sure it does _not_ get published.

On December 13, 2017 she published a photo of the manuscript on Facebook.

 Laurel Davies had posted the comments on her other profile called 'Lauren Davies' (the profile that was used to sell some of Rob's artwork). This profile is not publicly accessible anymore and might have been deactivated or deleted.

Following is copy of the entire thread from the facebook page. I intended to expand all comments, but aparrently missed a lot of them (unfortunately some of the more interesting ones) or I lost the screenshot in which I did:
