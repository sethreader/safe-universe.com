"Pretend a particular event happened that greatly disturbed you. In your mind imagine it not simply wiped out, but replaced by another event of even more beneficial nature. Now this must be done with great vividness and emotional validity, and many times. It is not a self-deception. The event that you choose will automatically be a probable event, which did in fact happen, though it is not the event that you chose to perceive in your given probable past."
