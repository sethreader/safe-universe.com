"Let us take an example. You sleep. While asleep you project yourself into the year 1972. There you see yourself considering various courses of action. For a moment you are aware of a sense of duality as you look at this older self You say you should do this or that, give a definite decision, you see. This may happen in several ways. We will go into this sort of thing more deeply in another session.

(Eyes open.) In any case this future self of yours heeds what you say. Now, in the actual future you are the self who one way or another, you see, hears the voice of his past self. (Jane leans forward, knocking on the tabletop for emphasis, eyes wide.) Perhaps in a dream, or perhaps in a projection, made into the past.

Before our break I will leave you with a few questions. Was there something your future self had forgotten? Did the future self request information, and did this request cause the present self, you see, to make an actual and legitimate projection into the future?"
