"As an exercise, occasionally catch yourself in some insignificant action - speaking, touching. If you speak for example be conscious of speaking and hearing yourself speak. Try to think of the words, or to experience them in terms of color. In terms of bulk, density, of distance. Think of the beginnings of the simple act of which you are normally almost completely unaware, the muscular motions that must be made before one word can be uttered.

Catch yourself in a simple thought and try to experience the beginnings of that action. You will be led into action indeed in a completely new way. Then try to experience this simple action as it affects others, not only emotionally and physically in terms of the changes it elicits from their complicated structures, but also the new actions it requires of them."
