This is a repository of material related to the body of work produced by "energy personality essence" [Seth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Material), through Jane Roberts and her husband Robert Butts. It is an attempt at organising the material to make it easier to access, as well as study. It is a collection of community-created documents that are available on the internet. Some of the documents have been slightly reworked or ported from PDF's to text. This is a work in progress. More content will be added periodically. This repository will be open-sourced at some point, to make contributions by others possible.
